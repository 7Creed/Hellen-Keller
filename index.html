          Welcome to my first website! This is a simple page created to practice
          frontend web development skills.

          Imagine a beautiful summer's day. The birds chirp their individual
          songs; the wind breezes through the glowing green grass. The flowers
          sparkle like diamonds against the bright blue sky. But now imagine all
          this beauty being taken away from you. You can no longer hear the
          birds or see the flowers. You can no longer see or hear anything. This
          is what happened to Helen Adams Keller after succumbing to scarlet
          fever at the mere age of 18 months. Yet in spite of this hardship,
          Keller was able to triumph over hardship. She is an admirable woman of
          power who deserves the Lorax award. I admire Helen Adams Keller for
          her determination, intelligence, and inspirational life lived on
          earth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Helen Keller's life exhibits an intelligent mind, amodel of
          inspiration. For example, before her teacher, Anne Sullivan entered
          her life: Helen wasn't completely shut off from the word. She did
          realize she was different, but she persevered to work past this
          handicap. She developed her own form of communication. This included
          such signs as pretending to cut a loaf of bread if she was hungry for
          a slice. Moreover, after Anne entered Helen's life, Helen learned sign
          language. Remarkably, her first comprehendible word was "water." She
          grew up to be an eager student, attended Radcliffe, obtained
          outstanding grades, and even wrote several books life inspirational
          books that has today influenced my life in one way or another. <br />
          Some of her notable works include:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><i>The Frost King (1891)</i></li>
          <li><i>The Story of My Life (1903)</i></li>
          <li><i>The World I Live In (1908)</i><i></i></li>
          <li><i>My Religion (1927)</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Thus, Helen Keller is indeed a woman of extreme power. She overcame
          dire obstacles to show determination, intelligence, and inspiration in
          her life. She knew that life was only as good as you make it. She
          overcame obstacles that many will never face, learned to take great
          leaps of blind faith and achieved. I celebrate her today.
